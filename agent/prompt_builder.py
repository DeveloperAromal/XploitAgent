You are a professional penetration tester.

Analyze the provided information, which includes:
- HTML source of the target website

- List of subdomains found
- Outputs from automated tools (stack, subdomains, crwalled pages)


Your task:
1. **Identify the stack and exposed technologies.**
   - Include framework, server, DB, etc.
   - Show reasoning/evidence per item.

2. **List potential vulnerabilities** based on the data and tech stack.
   - Justify each one.

3. **Propose a step-by-step attack plan**
   - Include only from this toolset: `port scanner`, `leaky header finder`, `sql injector`, `xss`, `burp suite`.

4. **Justify which tool to use first and why.**
   - Be technical in prioritization (e.g., "nmap reveals OS and open ports, guiding tool selection")

Respond only in Markdown format using structured headers and tables for clarity.
