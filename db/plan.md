**Analysis and Report**

### **1. Identify the Stack and Exposed Technologies**

| **Category** | **Technology** | **Evidence** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend/Framework** | Next.js | Presence of `/dashboard/profile/p/1`, `/_next/static/...` in HTML |
| **CSS Framework** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first class names (e.g., `text-5xl`, `bg-zinc-800`) |
| **Server** | **Unknown** | - |
| **Database** | **Unknown** | - |
| **Subdomains Found** | 
| &#x20; | `www.ontraq.in` | Provided |
| &#x20; | `api.ontraq.in` | Detected in HTML (`https://api.ontraq.in/dashboard`) |
| **Detected Tool Outputs** | **None Provided** | Assume no pre-scanned outputs for this analysis |

### **2. List Potential Vulnerabilities based on the Data**

| **Vulnerability** | **Reason for Inclusion** |
| --- | --- |
| **IDOR (Identity-Based Directory Traversal/Access)** | Explicitly mentioned in HTML for "Profile (IDOR)" section |
| **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** | Common in web apps, especially without evidence of CSRF tokens |
| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** | Depends on input validation/sanitization for comment wall/file uploads |
| **Information Disclosure** | Potential broader issue given IDOR mention and user ID exposure |
| **API Vulnerabilities (e.g., Insecure Auth, Rate Limiting)** | Common in APIs without specifics on `api.ontraq.in` security |
| **Server/Database Specific Vulnerabilities** | Unknown, dependent on unidentified server/database tech |

### **3. Propose a Step-by-Step Attack Plan**

#### **Tools Selected for the Plan:**
- **nmap**
- **Leaky Header Finder** (Custom Script or Tool, e.g., `PentestLab's Header checker`)
- **Network Interceptor** (e.g., Burp Suite)

#### **Step-by-Step Attack Plan:**

##### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance & Server Tech ID**

1. **nmap Scan**
   - **Command**: `nmap -sT -sV -O -p 1-1024,443,8080 www.ontraq.in api.ontraq.in`
   - **Objective**: Identify open ports, server software (if not hidden), and OS
   - **Expected Outcome**: Potential revelation of server technology (e.g., Node.js, Apache, Nginx)

##### **Phase 2: Exposed Headers Analysis**

2. **Leaky Header Finder**
   - **Tool/Script**: Run against `www.ontraq.in` and `api.ontraq.in`
   - **Objective**: Uncover potentially leaked headers revealing tech stack components
   - **Example Expected Output**: `Server: Next.js <Version>` (though unlikely to reveal Next.js server-side directly), `X-Powered-By`

##### **Phase 3: Application Layer Testing**

3. **Network Interceptor (Burp Suite)**
   - **a. CSRF Testing**:
     - Intercept and modify requests to comment wall/file upload endpoints.
     - **Objective**: Verify presence/effectiveness of CSRF tokens.
   - **b. IDOR Confirmation**:
     - Manipulate `/dashboard/profile/p/<ID>` requests.
     - **Objective**: Confirm IDOR vulnerability.
   - **c. XSS Testing (Basic)**:
     - Inject basic XSS payloads into input fields.
     - **Objective**: Initial assessment of XSS protection (in-depth testing may require more tailored approaches)

##### **Phase 4: Deeper Dive (Based on Phase 1-3 Findings)**

- **Dependent on Discoveries**:
  - If Server Tech Identified: Research and test for tech-specific vulnerabilities.
  - If API Endpoints Exposed: Perform in-depth API security testing.
  - **Tool Selection**: Based on findings, tools like `sqlmap` (for SQLi if applicable), or more targeted API testing with Postman/Burp.

### **4. Justify Which Tool to Use First and Why**

- **First Tool: `nmap`**
- **Justification**:
  1. **Non-Intrusive**: Initial reconnaissance with minimal risk of detection.
  2. **Broad Insight**: Provides a wide overview of the target's network exposure.
  3. **Foundation for Next Steps**: Identifying the server and potentially the OS informs how to tailor the next phases of testing (e.g., choosing the right exploits, understanding potential server vulnerabilities).
  4. **Preparation for Tool Efficacy**: Knowing the server tech can enhance the efficacy of subsequent tool usage (e.g., configuring Burp Suite for specific server vulnerabilities).

### **Detailed Example Commands and Expectations for Clarity**

#### **nmap Command with Expected Output Snippet**

| **Command** | `nmap -sT -sV -O -p 1-1024,443,8080 www.ontraq.in` |
| --- | --- |
| **Expected Output Snippet** | ```
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open  http    Node.js (http server)
443/tcp   open  ssl/http Node.js (http server)
8080/tcp  open  http    Next.js (erverless Functions?)

OS details: Linux 5.4 - 5.10
Network Distance: 2 hops
```
| 
| **Note**: The actual output may vary significantly based on the target's configuration and `nmap`'s ability to accurately detect services.

#### **Leaky Header Finder Example**

| **Tool Output** | `Server: nginx/1.20.1, X-Powered-By: Node.js` |
| --- | --- |
| **Inference** | Potential reverse proxy setup with nginx in front of a Node.js server |

#### **Burp Suite Intercept for IDOR**

| **Original Request** | `GET /dashboard/profile/p/1 HTTP/1.1` |
| --- | --- |
| **Modified Request (Burp)** | `GET /dashboard/profile/p/3 HTTP/1.1` |
| **Response Analysis** | Verify if profile for ID=3 is returned without authorization |
